# Nor-Cal-Spring-Hackathon-Project

This is my project for the 2023 Nor Cal Hackathon

I worked on this project alone which was fun aand not fun but in all it was a succes.

The project is an encryption Gui which encrypts you inputs into either Morse code, Cryptography or the famous Ceasar's cipher. 

The best option is you can also derypt everything.

You can run the main.exe file to run it directly or run it in your ide by opening the main.py.

You need these modules to work

--pip install cryptography--

--pip install pyperclip--

--pip install ttkbootstrap--

Then you are done, and also you need python installed lol
